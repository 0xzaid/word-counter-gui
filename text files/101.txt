The sun was setting over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the small town. As the streets emptied and the shops closed for the night, a young woman sat on her front porch, lost in thought. She had just received some difficult news and wasn't sure what to do.

As she sat there, a gentle breeze blew through the trees, rustling the leaves and lifting her hair. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, letting the peace of the evening wash over her.

Just then, she heard a soft tap on her shoulder. She turned to see an old friend standing there, a warm smile on their face. "Hey, I saw you sitting here and thought you might want some company," they said.

The young woman's face lit up and she nodded, grateful for the understanding and support of her friend. Together, they sat and watched the stars come out, talking and laughing until the night was late.
